            <h2>About Me:</h2>
<h4>My name is Brandon Vuong. I am an aspiring digital artist and dabble in other mediums. My interpretation of art is bringing about change and making strong statements that speak louder than the rioting souls we all carry individually within ourselves. This portfolio is an embodiment of my slow and methodical descent into art and this is where I try and make sense of a nonsensical world with my own two hands.</h4>

<p>Born and raised in the Silicon Valley where rent is too high and creativity is at an all time low. My inspiration stems from Shepard Fairey and Banksey where art becomes a weapon against the modern day giants and tyrannical fists with their blur-bars in hand. </p>
