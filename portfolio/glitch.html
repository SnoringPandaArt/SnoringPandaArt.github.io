    <h2>Mish, Mashed, Moshed</h2>
    <h3>Exploration of delving deeper into what lies underneath pictures we see in our daily lives and making a mess of the image beyond recognition.</h3>

    <p>"Mished" 2024. Sept. 07 Data Bending demonstration. Before mashing a potato, you're expected to peel a potato and then mashed. Maybe I missed a few steps before I got here. This involved the use of going into the code make-up of the image and adding in unconventional code strings that gave me this.</p>

    <p>"Mashed" 2024. Sept. 07 Data Bending and Data Moshing demonstration where a harmless photo of commercial ready mashed potato gets bent. If we can mash the insides of a potato, what's stopping us from doing the same with the photo's code?</p>

    <p>"Moshed" 2024. Sept. 07 Data Moshing demonstration. Something funny about digitally cooking an image until it's essentially burnt. My demonstration is meant to highlight the usage of highlighting a code of an image and using other tools like Audacity and Note Pad++ and mashing the two tools together. Some use ricers, others use mashers, I used programs.</p>
